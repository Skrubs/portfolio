Coding Tools & IDE Setup –
	For ease of development, IntelliJ is the suggested IDE for all group members to use for our Dynamic Portfolio project. Versioning control is handled through the use of a GitHub project; each team member is responsible for creating a branch to work on a specific feature that is then merged into the master branch once reviewed. The project will be built using a PERN stack with the following breakdown.
 
	Postgres – For the relational database which will store user data and facilitate sessions and authentication. 
	ExpressJS -  Back-end framework
	React – Front-end framework
	Node.js – Back-end platform
